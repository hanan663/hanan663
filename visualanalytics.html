        <h1>Summary of the visual analytics process</h1>
        <p>
        <h3>What Visual analytics is?</h3>
        "Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with interactive visualizations for an effective
        understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex datasets".
        <br><br>
        <b>The goals of visual analytics are:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting
                data.
            </li>
            <li>Detect the expected and discover the unexpected.</li>
            <li>Provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments.</li>
            <li>Communicate these assessments effectively for action.</li>
        </ul>
        Visual analytics integrates science and technology from many disciplines, as shown in Figure1

        There are many application areas of visual analytics such as physics and astronomy where large information spaces have to be processed and analyzed.
        <br><br>
        <b>The Visual Analytics Process</b>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>first step is often to preprocess and transform the data to derive different representations for further exploration. Other typical preprocessing tasks include data cleaning, normalization, grouping, or integration of heterogeneous data sources.</li>
            <li>The analyst may choose between applying visual or automatic analysis methods.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If an automated analysis is used first, data mining methods are applied to generate models of the original data. Once a model is created the analyst has to evaluate and refine the model, which can best be done by interacting with the data. </li>
                <li>Visualizations allow the analysts to interact with the automatic methods by modifying parameters or selecting other analysis algorithms. Model visualization can then be used to evaluate the findings of the generated models.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        In summary, in the visual analytics, knowledge can be gained from visualization, automatic analysis, as well as the preceding interactions between visualizations, models, and the human analysts.

        <h3>What Data management is?</h3>
        Data management provides methods for effectively dealing with large datasets. The techniques aim to ensure data consistency, avoiding duplication and handling data transactions in a formal way.
        </p>
    <br>
        <b>Information visualization can play role in enhancing data management activities which are:</b>
        <dl>
            <dt>Data integration</dt>
            <dd>Data integration is the problem of providing unified and transparent access to a set of autonomous and heterogeneous sources, in order to allow for expressing queries that could not be supported by the individual data sources alone.</dd>
            <dt>Data warehouse and Data minin</dt>
            <dd>A data warehouse is an integrated repository of data that can be easily understood, interpreted, and analyzed by the people who need to use it to make decisions.
            </dd>
            <dd>Data mining is the process of discovering knowledge or patterns from massive amounts of data through ad hoc algorithms.
            </dd>
            <dt>Data Reduction and Abstraction</dt>
            <dd>the purpose of data reduction in the context of data management is to save computational or disk access costs in query processing or to increase the systems responsiveness during interactive analysis. Data reduction relies on various techniques, like histograms, clustering, singular value decomposition, discrete wavelet transforms, etc.</dd>
            <dt>Data Quality</dt>
            <dd>Dealing with missing data and duplicate records is only part of the overall process of data cleansing. We also need to identify and either correct or reject data that is incorrect or inaccurate, possibly through the use of aggregate data statistics. Additionally, the data many need to be standardised by, for example, adjusting the data format and measurement units.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Many challenges and opportunities associated with data management and visual analytics exist. They are related to solving basic data management problems that will help visual analytics activities, or to addressing problems arising from specific requirements of visual analytics. On the other hand, data management could fruitfully exploit by some results coming from visual analytics research. However, in order to make progress in the visual analytics field, we need to address some critical issues such as uncertainty problems, semantic data integration and semantics management, data provenance, data streaming, interactive visualization of huge datasets, solving process intensive activities, and designing visual analytics systems intended for the general public. Dealing with these issues is a challenge that both communities have to take up, in order to take advantage of the increasing information opportunities available today.</p>
