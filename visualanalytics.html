        <h1>Summary of the visual analytics process</h1>
        <p>
        <h3>What Visual analytics is?</h3>
        "Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with interactive visualizations for an effective
        understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex datasets".
        <br><br>
        <b>The goals of visual analytics are:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting
                data.
            </li>
            <li>Detect the expected and discover the unexpected.</li>
            <li>Provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments.</li>
            <li>Communicate these assessments effectively for action.</li>
        </ul>
        Visual analytics integrates science and technology from many disciplines, as shown in Figure1

        There are many application areas of visual analytics such as physics and astronomy where large information spaces have to be processed and analyzed.

        <b>The Visual Analytics Process</b>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>first step is often to preprocess and transform the data to derive different representations for further exploration. Other typical preprocessing tasks include data cleaning, normalization, grouping, or integration of heterogeneous data sources.</li>
            <li>The analyst may choose between applying visual or automatic analysis methods.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If an automated analysis is used first, data mining methods are applied to generate models of the original data. Once a model is created the analyst has to evaluate and refine the model, which can best be done by interacting with the data. </li>
                <li>Visualizations allow the analysts to interact with the automatic methods by modifying parameters or selecting other analysis algorithms. Model visualization can then be used to evaluate the findings of the generated models.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        In summary, in the visual analytics, knowledge can be gained from visualization, automatic analysis, as well as the preceding interactions between visualizations, models, and the human analysts.

        <h3>What Data management is?</h3>
        Data management provides methods for effectively dealing with large datasets. The techniques aim to ensure data consistency, avoiding duplication and handling data transactions in a formal way.
